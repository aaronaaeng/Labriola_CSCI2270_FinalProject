My program will act as a virtual baseball scorecard. A scorecard is used by anyone instersted in stat keeping at a baseball game to record the outcome of each at-bat in a baseball game. This program will use the same idea and allow the user to input the outcome of an at-bat for every at-bat in a game. After the game is finished, the user can look up any game and see the statistics for each player as well as the box score for the game. The program will have the relevant statistics for each player that starts as well as any replacment players.
